Important implementation issues are when to send messages
(i.e., when to activate the communication thread) and which
buffer to select.
The optimal strategy is game-dependent.
In general, if messages are sent too soon, the algorithm will send
many small messages, resulting in a high communication overhead.
On the other hand, if messages are sent too late, the receiving
processors may run out of work, resulting in wasted CPU time.
Another issue is how to partition
the database among the available processors, which has an impact
on load balancing.
These issues will be discussed in Section <A HREF="node14.html#awariperf">5.2</A>.

The algorithm uses processes that repeatedly generate work for each other.
Each update message may result in new work, since the value in the
message may be used to establish the final value of the parent entry.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine when the algorithm can
terminate a given iteration.
Termination detection is required at
the end of each iteration of the algorithm, since all processes must
always be working on the same iteration.
We have implemented a reasonably efficient termination detection algorithm,
but the description of the algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper.

Another issue we have ignored so far is deadlock. In theory, deadlock
could occur if the input and output buffers get full. In this case,
some worker and communication threads might block. If a cycle
exists among such blocked threads, a deadlock situation might arise.
To prevent this situation, we dynamically adjust the sizes of the
buffers, so that threads do not have to block while putting data into
a buffer.
