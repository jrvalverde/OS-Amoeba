We assume that we create an endgame database for a two-player zero-sum game
with perfect information, and that the value of each game is an integer
between <b>-N</b> and <b>N</b>. The value of a game is based on the value of the end
position of the game, and points the players may have accumulated during the
game (by making moves which are worth a specified number of points).
In awari and go, a player can score points during the game, by capturing
stones. In chess and checkers, the value of the game is based solely on the
end position; the value can be a win (1) draw (0), or loss(<b>-1</b>), so <b>N = 1</b>.
<P>
For each legal game position we would like to calculate the best score
obtainable for the player to move. For non-end positions, the score is based
on the values of its children and on the values of the moves leading to
those children. Let us suppose that in the current position, <b>P</b>, the only
legal move leads to a position, <b>Q</b>, with value <b>k</b>. As in <b>Q</b> the opponent
is to move, this means that the opponent can win in <b>Q</b> by <b>k</b> points.
From the perspective of the player to move in <b>P</b>, this is equivalent to
a value of <b>-k</b>.               
If the move from <b>P</b> to <b>Q</b> scores <b>x</b> points,
then the total value obtainable through this move is <b>-k+x</b>. Thus, when knowing
the values of all children of a position, and the values of all moves leading
to those children, we can calculate the value of the position.
Furthermore, we assume that if the game gets into
a cycle (repetition of positions),
the game is a draw (i.e., both players are awarded 0 points).
