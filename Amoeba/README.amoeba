Amoeba is a distributed operating system intended to connect a large number
of computers together in a transparent way.  This directory contains:

	Intro.ps.Z:	An introduction to Amoeba and how to obtain it
	manuals:	A directory with all the Amoeba manuals
	amoeba_papers:	A directory with published papers on Amoeba
	orca_papers:	A directory with published papers on Orca

Both the 'papers' and the 'orca' directories have a file 'INDEX' telling
what is present in the directories.
